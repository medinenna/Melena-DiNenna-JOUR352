Questions

1.  In the sentence below, put in the necessary code that would allow users to click on the word Google and open Google's homepage in a new browser:

<a href="google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> is the best search engine in the world.




2.  Describe the purpose of a DIV tag.
A DIV tag, short for "Division," divides the contents of an HTML file. It helps create structure and organization. When using DIV tags, coders can categorize sections of the file with identifiers and classes, which then make it easier to target the content within that DIV when applying style in CSS.



3.  Write out the basic structure of an HTML page, putting the basic tags in the correct position.  (Note: you don't need to connect it to a stylesheet or include DIV tags or anything like that).

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
  <title>[title]</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>[heading]</h1>
    <p>[paragraph]</p>
</body>

</html>


4.  There are two main "areas" or "sections" in the basic structure of an HTML page. In which area would you put a link to a stylesheet?
In the head (<head>, not <h1>).


5.  In which main "area" or "section" of an HTML page would you put text, images or DIV tags?
In the body (<body>).


6.  In the space below, put one DIV tag with a class of graphicbox and a second DIV tag with an ID of name.

9.  What tag would we use to include an image on an HTML page? Just give me the name of the tag, you don't have to write out all the code.

10.  Why do we use media queries?

Media queries help adjust a website's design elements to fit various sizes of screens, such as laptops and mobile phones. This ensures that viewers will have the same quality viewing experience regardless of how they're accessing the website.


11. What is the main difference between a serif and a sans-serif font?

Serif fonts have "serifs," which means each letter has a small lines at every end. Sans-serif fonts do not have serifs, so the letters appear more simplistic.


12. Which of the following is a hexadecimal code?
#FFCC33
123,543,242

-213

answer: #FFCC33
